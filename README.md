# Ilon's Mask Stock

## Story

As a wrap-up project in Codecool's second module "Web", our task was to build a web app for hospitals to order masks.

## Tech stack

- Node JS, Express JS
- MongooseJS
- store data with mongoDB
- React JS, CSS
- connect to an API on the server side (fetch GET/POST)

## Functionality

- registration with admin getting an email,
- user password securely stored, hashed with bcrypt,
- authenticated endpoints in the backend,
- JWT token generation,
- redirect for unauthorized pages on frontend,
- stay logged in after refresh using localstorage and JWT token,
- admin page for verifying users, admin rights management,
- login functionality,
- store user preferences about user's own hospitals,
- order page,
- order history page (users see their own, admin sees all),
- automatic invoice generation and sending using Billingo API (fetch from backend).

## Extra

I have deployed this project to https://kriptoalapok.hu/ilonmask/ to share it with anyone curious.
